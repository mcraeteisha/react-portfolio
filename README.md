## Technologies Used
* React
* Styled Components
 
## Work Completed

Using VS Code, React, Styled Components, and GitHub Pages, I completed the following:

* Created a professional portfolio
* Built components to render to different pages of the portfolio
 
## Learnings and Issues
Some of the learnings I'm taking away from this project are:
1. An issue I ran into with this project was deployment. I'd never attempted to deploy a React App before this. While the documentation was thorough, I ran into some issues in my terminal. However, after doing some more careful reading, I was able to get the project successfully deployed.

## Future Application Updates
* Add functionality to the Contact form
* Create a single component for the Project tiles in the Portfolio
